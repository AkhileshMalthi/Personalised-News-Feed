## Personalised News Feed - React Frontend Guide

This guide outlines building the frontend for a Personalised News Feed application using React. It assumes a basic understanding of React concepts and component structure.

**Project Setup:**

1. Utilize `create-react-app` to set up the project:

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app personalised-news-feed
   cd personalised-news-feed
   ```

**Component Structure:**

Organize your code using reusable components:

```
personalised-news-feed/
├── src/
│   ├── App.js  # Main application component
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── Header.js  # Header component for branding and navigation
│   │   ├── Signup.js  # Component for user signup form
│   │   ├── Login.js  # Component for user login form
│   │   ├── Profile.js  # Component for user profile management
│   │   ├── NewsFeed.js  # Component displaying personalized news articles
│   │   └── NewsCard.js  # Component for individual news article display
│   └── index.js  # Entry point for the React application
```

**User Interface Development:**

* **Header Component (`Header.js`)**
    * Design a header with logo, navigation links, and potentially a search bar.
    * Consider using UI component libraries like Material-UI or Bootstrap for pre-built components and styling.
* **Signup and Login Components (`Signup.js` & `Login.js`)**
    * Create separate components for user registration and login.
    * Utilize forms to capture user information during signup and credentials during login.
    * Implement logic to handle form submissions and user authentication (likely handled by the backend API).
* **Profile Component (`Profile.js`)**
    * Allow users to view and edit their profile details (name, email, interests, preferred sources).
    * Use controlled components to manage form data and update the user profile on the server-side.
* **News Feed Component (`NewsFeed.js`)**
    * Display personalized news articles based on the user's profile.
    * Fetch data from a backend API containing filtered and potentially summarized news articles.
    * Utilize React's state management (useState or Redux) to handle dynamic updates.
* **News Card Component (`NewsCard.js`)**
    * Design components to display individual news articles within the feed.
    * Extract relevant information (headline, source, snippet, image URL) and render them visually using CSS or styling libraries.

**Integration with Backend and LLM:**

* The frontend won't directly interact with the LLM. It communicates with a backend API that handles LLM interactions.
* Develop backend API endpoints for user management and fetching personalized news feeds.
* These backend APIs will interact with the LLM service (using its API) to process user profiles and filter news articles.

**Additional Considerations:**

* Implement user authentication and authorization.
* Include error handling and user feedback messages.
* Consider responsive design techniques for different screen sizes (e.g., React Bootstrap).

**Further Exploration:**

* Deep dive into individual component development and styling.
* Explore data fetching techniques using libraries like Axios.
* Consider integrating a state management solution (Redux) for complex application logic.

This guide provides a starting point for building the React frontend. Remember to adapt it to your specific project requirements and chosen styling libraries.

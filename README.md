## Smart Personalized News Feed

This project builds a web application using MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with a machine learning component for a personalized news feed experience.

**Features:**

- Users can browse news articles from various sources.
- The application recommends relevant news articles based on user interactions (saved articles, browsing history) and content analysis of the articles.
- Users can interact with the news feed by saving articles and potentially adjusting their preferences.

**Technologies Used:**

- **Front-end:** React
- **Back-end:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB
- **Machine Learning:** Python (optional, libraries like TensorFlow.js or scikit-learn)

**Getting Started:**

1. **Prerequisites:**
    - Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
    - A MongoDB database running locally or on a cloud platform.
    - Basic understanding of React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and machine learning concepts (optional).

2. **Clone the project:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://your-github-repo/smart-personalized-news-feed.git
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   - Navigate to the project root directory.
   - Install dependencies for the front-end:

     ```bash
     cd client
     npm install  # or yarn install
     ```

   - Install dependencies for the back-end:

     ```bash
     cd ../server
     npm install  # or yarn install
     ```

   - Install dependencies for the machine learning component (if using Python):

     ```bash
     cd ../ml
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Configure environment variables:**

   - Create a `.env` file in the project root directory.
   - Add environment variables for sensitive information like API keys or database connection strings.

     ```
     # Example entries in .env
     REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_api_key
     MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your_database_name
     ```

5. **Run the application:**

   - Start the MongoDB database.
   - Start the back-end server:

     ```bash
     cd ../server
     node app.js
     ```

   - Start the React development server:

     ```bash
     cd ../client
     npm start  # or yarn start
     ```

   - The application should be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or a different port if specified).
